# CONFERENCE REGISTRATION FORM  
## Project Overview  
The Conference Registration Form is designed as part of a task to understand and apply HTML form nesting techniques. This form captures essential attendee details, preferred conference sessions, meal preferences, and allows for the registration of additional attendees.  

## Features
**The form includes the following sections:**  

- Personal Information 
- Conference Track Selection
- Meal Preference
- Additional Attendee  

## Requirements
To ensure clean code and clarity, this form uses only HTML elements and avoids CSS and JavaScript for styling or interactivity. Specific form elements include:  

- Text inputs for names, emails, etc.
- Radio buttons for session preferences
- Checkboxes for workshop selections
- Select dropdowns for track choices
- Textareas for dietary restrictions or notes

## HTML Structure
This form is structured using nested `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags, which provide clear visual grouping and enhance accessibility. Each section is wrapped in fieldsets for organization, with nested fieldsets as necessary to group specific details like meal preferences and track selection.  

## Code Structure
- The code is organized with clear indentation to reflect nesting levels and improve readability.
- Each element uses meaningful names to ensure clarity and maintainability.
- The entire form is encapsulated within an outermost <form> tag, with inner sections grouped by fieldsets for a structured, user-friendly layout.Code Structure
